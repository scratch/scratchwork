# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-24

This release includes internal refactoring for better maintainability, improved developer experience, and security hardening for HTML output.

### Improvements

- Dev server now watches the `public/` directory for changes, triggering rebuilds when static assets are modified
- Syntax highlighting now supports all languages bundled with Shiki (previously limited to a small subset)
- Confirmation prompts in `bun run pr` and `bun run release` now default to "yes" for faster workflows

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed potential XSS vulnerability by properly escaping frontmatter values when injecting meta tags into HTML
- Improved error messages when components referenced in MDX files are not found

## [0.0.9] - 2025-12-24

This release simplifies project creation with better defaults and fixes a critical build issue when dependencies need to be installed.

### Improvements

- `scratch create` now includes `src/`, examples, and `package.json` by default (use `--no-src`, `--no-examples`, `--no-package` to exclude)
- `scratch create` no longer auto-installs dependencies after project creation
- Removed interactive prompts from `scratch create` - now purely flag-based for scripting
- Removed `--minimal` and `--full` shorthand flags from create command
- `scratch revert` now prompts for confirmation before overwriting existing files
- Added `--force` flag to `scratch revert` to skip confirmation prompts
- `scratch revert package.json` now works (generates a fresh package.json)
- Improved error messages when builds fail

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed build failures that occurred when dependencies were auto-installed during the same build process
- Fixed `scratch revert` to work correctly in non-interactive environments (scripts, CI)

## [0.0.8] - 2025-12-23

This release adds a new pull request creation script and improves the reliability of the release workflow.

### Features

- Added `bun run pr` command to create GitHub pull requests with AI-generated titles and descriptions

### Improvements

- Release and PR scripts now use `--print` mode with Claude Code for cleaner output
- Added resume mode for both release and PR scripts - if interrupted, re-running the command continues from where it left off
- Improved confirmation prompts when resuming release or PR creation
- Release workflow now extracts release notes from CHANGELOG.md instead of auto-generating them

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed git status parsing in release and PR scripts to correctly handle the porcelain format
- PR script now always pushes the branch to ensure remote is up-to-date before creating PR
- PR script now explicitly specifies the repository when creating pull requests
- Fixed prompt passing to Claude Code CLI (using `-p` flag)
