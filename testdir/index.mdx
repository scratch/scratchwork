Scratch compiles Markdown and React into beautiful static websites that can be hosted anywhere.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install scratch
curl -fsSL https://scratch.dev/install.sh | bash

# Create a new project
scratch create

# Start the dev server
scratch dev
```

## What can you do with Scratch?

Scratch lets you write in Markdown and embed interactive React components, like this counter:

<Counter />

Scratch was designed for collaborative writing with coding agents like [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code). Use your favorite editor to write in Markdown, and ask a coding agent for help when it's easier to express yourself with code.

You can use React components to <Fire>style text</Fire> or embed fully working demos in your product specs:

<TodoList />

Scratch uses [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography), to render your prose with a clean aesthetic. Code blocks use syntax highlighting by [Shiki](https://shiki.style/).

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

Scratch also supports Github-flavored Markdown features like checklists and tables:

| Feature | Supported? |
|---------|-----------|
| Compiles Markdown, TS, JS & CSS | ✅ |
| Dev server with HMR | ✅ |
| Tailwind CSS styling | ✅ |
| Code syntax highlighting | ✅ |

Unlike traditional word processors, Scratch makes it easy to express any idea. If you can describe it to a coding  agent, you can add it to your document:

<BouncingDvdLogo />

Collaborating with AI makes writing more fun. Scratch makes that easy.

## No Boilerplate

Scratch uses an opinionated project structure and requires **no boilerplate or configuration**: just create a project, run the dev server with `scratch dev`, and start writing.

A simple Scratch project (created with `scratch create`) looks like this:

<Files content={`
my-scratch-project/
-pages/                 # put markdown and components here
--index.mdx
--Counter.tsx
-public/ (collapsed)    # static assets
--favicon.svg
-src/ (collapsed)       # global components and css
--PageWrapper.jsx       # wraps every page
--tailwind.css          # global styles
--markdown/ (collapsed) # default markdown components
---index.ts
---CodeBlock.tsx
---Heading.tsx
---Link.tsx
-AGENTS.md              # agent context
-package.json           # dependencies
-.gitignore
`} />


Use `scratch build` to compile this project into a static website, like [this one](https://github.com/scratch/scratch.dev).

Component files and libraries can live anywhere in `pages/` and `src/`. They are auto-detected by Scratch and don't need to be explicitly imported in your .mdx files as long as the filename matches the component name.

Modify `src/tailwind.css` directory to change the styling of your document. Add headers, footers and other site-wide elements by modifying `src/PageWrapper.jsx`.

## Commands

```bash
# Create a new project
scratch create [path]     # create project at path (default: current directory)

# Start dev server with hot module reloading
scratch dev

# Build for production
scratch build
scratch build --no-ssg        # disable static site generation
scratch build --development   # unminified, with source maps

# Preview production build locally
scratch preview

# Remove build artifacts
scratch clean

# Revert a file to its template version
scratch checkout [file]           # revert a file to its template version
scratch checkout --force [file]   # overwrite without confirmation
scratch checkout --list           # list available template files

# Update scratch to latest version
scratch update
```

## Acknowledgements


[Bun](https://bun.com/) for lightning-fast builds, development with HMR, native typescript support, and a portable executable.

[React](https://react.dev/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) make it possible to write with Markdown and code. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) makes component styling easy.

Content preprocessing relies on [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/), with [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) for GitHub Flavored Markdown and [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter) plus [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) for parsing front matter.

[Shiki](https://shiki.style/) provides beautiful, accurate syntax highlighting with VS Code's grammar engine.

[Commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) scaffolds the CLI.
