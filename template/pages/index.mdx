It's great for building personal websites like [koomen.dev](https://koomen.dev) or writing technical content with interactive components like [this essay](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages).

- **No boilerplate** - Just put markdown in `pages/`, code in `components/` 
- **MDX support** - Embed interactive react components in your writing
- **Built on [Bun](https://bun.com/)** - Fast builds, hot reloads, and built-in typescript support
