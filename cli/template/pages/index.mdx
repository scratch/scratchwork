![Scratch Logo](/scratch-logo.svg)

Scratch is a tool for writing with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [React](https://react.dev/).

Write in Markdown and embed React components right in your text. Scratch compiles your work into beautiful static websites (like [this one](https://github.com/scratch/scratch.dev)) that can be hosted anywhere.

Scratch was designed for collaborative writing with coding agents like [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code). Use your favorite editor to write in Markdown and ask an agent for help when it's easier to express yourself with code.


## Quick Start

Scratch requires no configuration so it's easy to get started. First, install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://scratch.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Then create a project and start the dev server:

```bash
scratch create
scratch dev
```

Now you're ready to start writing in `pages/index.mdx`.

## What can you do with Scratch?

Scratch lets you write in Markdown and embed interactive React components, like this counter:

You can use React components to <Fire>style text</Fire> or embed fully working demos in your product specs:

Scratch uses [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography), to render your prose with a clean aesthetic. Code blocks use syntax highlighting by [Shiki](https://shiki.style/).

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

Scratch also supports GitHub-flavored Markdown features like checklists and tables:

| Feature | Supported? |
|---------|-----------|
| Compiles Markdown, TS, JS & CSS | ✅ |
| Dev server with HMR | ✅ |
| Tailwind CSS styling | ✅ |
| Code syntax highlighting | ✅ |

Unlike traditional word processors, Scratch makes it easy to express any idea. If you can describe it to a coding  agent, you can add it to your document:

Collaborating with AI makes writing more fun. Scratch makes that easy.

## No Boilerplate

Scratch uses an opinionated project structure and requires **no boilerplate or configuration**: just create a project, run the dev server with `scratch dev`, and start writing.

A simple Scratch project (created with `scratch create`) looks like this:

<Files>
```
my-scratch-project/
  pages/                 # put markdown pages and components here
    posts/ (collapsed)
      post1.md           # accessible at /posts/post1
      post2.md           # /posts/post2
      blog.png           # static assets in pages/ or public/
    index.mdx            # accessible at root path (/)
    Counter.tsx
  public/ (collapsed)    # static assets
    favicon.svg
  src/ (collapsed)       # global components and css
    markdown/ (collapsed) # default markdown components
      index.ts
      CodeBlock.tsx
      Heading.tsx
      Link.tsx
    template/ (collapsed) # page template components
      Copyright.jsx
      Footer.jsx
      Header.jsx
      PageWrapper.jsx       # wraps every page
      ScratchBadge.jsx
    tailwind.css          # global styles
  AGENTS.md              # agent context
  package.json           # dependencies
  .gitignore
```
</Files>


Use `scratch build` to compile this project into a static website, like [this one](https://github.com/scratch/scratch.dev).

Component files and libraries can live anywhere in `pages/` and `src/`. They are auto-detected by Scratch and don't need to be explicitly imported in your .mdx files as long as the filename matches the component name.

Modify `src/tailwind.css` directory to change the styling of your document. Add headers, footers and other site-wide elements by modifying `src/PageWrapper.jsx`.

## Commands

Here's a quick list of the Scratch CLI commands. See the [Scratch docs](https://scratch.dev/docs/) for a full rundown.

```bash
# Create a new project
scratch create [path]     # create project at path (default: current directory)

# Start dev server with hot module reloading
scratch dev

# Build for production
scratch build

# Preview production build locally
scratch preview

# Serve target file/directory on dev server
scratch watch path

# Remove build artifacts
scratch clean

# Revert a file to its template version
scratch checkout path           # revert file/directory to its template version

# Update scratch to latest version
scratch update
```

## Acknowledgements

[Bun](https://bun.com/) for lightning-fast builds, development with HMR, native TypeScript support, and a portable executable.

[React](https://react.dev/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) make it possible to write with Markdown and code. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) makes component styling easy.

Content preprocessing relies on [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/), with [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) for GitHub Flavored Markdown and [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter) plus [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) for parsing front matter.

[Shiki](https://shiki.style/) provides beautiful, accurate syntax highlighting with VS Code's grammar engine.

[Commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) scaffolds the CLI.
