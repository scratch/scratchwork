# Changelog

## [0.5.15] - 2026-02-01

This release improves the server selection experience when publishing to multiple servers.

### Improvements

- When logged into multiple servers, the `publish` command now always prompts for server selection instead of silently using the global default
- Server selection prompt now pre-selects the global default server when set, making it faster to confirm
- Cleaner server URL display in prompts (e.g., `scratch.dev` instead of `https://app.scratch.dev`)

## [0.5.14] - 2026-02-01

This release fixes the global defaults feature to work correctly with the `publish` command.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `publish` command to respect global config defaults for `server_url` and `visibility` set via `scratch set-defaults`
- Fixed server URL resolution to check global config before falling back to the default server
- Fixed visibility prompt to use global default when no project-level visibility is configured

## [0.5.13] - 2026-02-01

This release adds a new command for configuring global defaults and improves cache management.

### Features

- Added `scratch set-defaults` command to configure global defaults (server URL and visibility) stored in `~/.config/scratch/config.toml`. Supports both interactive mode and non-interactive mode with `--server` and `--visibility` flags.

### Improvements

- Moved CLI cached node_modules from `~/.scratch/[version]/` to `~/.scratch/cache/[version]/` to isolate cache from other files like credentials
- Old cache versions are now automatically cleaned up when installing dependencies for a new CLI version, preventing accumulation over time

## [0.5.12] - 2026-02-01

This release fixes routing issues in the `watch` command when viewing index files.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `scratch watch` to open the correct route when watching a single file (e.g., watching `about.md` now opens `/about` instead of `/`)
- Fixed `scratch watch` to handle `index.md` files without conflicts from the template's `index.mdx`

## [0.5.11] - 2026-02-01

This release adds support for publishing to naked domains and includes internal code cleanup.

### Features

- Added `--www` flag to `publish` command for deploying to naked domains (e.g., `example.com` instead of `pages.example.com/user/project`). When used, the site is built without path prefixes for root-level hosting.

### Improvements

- Removed ~2,100 lines of dead code and consolidated duplicate utilities across the codebase
- Extracted shared helper functions for browser opening, port fallback, zip creation, and date formatting
- Simplified template components (TodoList, Marquis animation)
- Removed unused dependency patch for estree-util-build-jsx

## [0.5.10] - 2026-01-31

This release standardizes the CLI interface by using a consistent `--server` flag across all server commands.

### Improvements

- Standardized server URL to use `--server <url>` option flag instead of positional `[server-url]` argument for all commands (`login`, `logout`, `whoami`, `projects`, `tokens`, `share`, `cf-access`)
- Added `--server` flag to share commands (`share create`, `share ls`, `share revoke`) which previously had no server parameter
- Simplified default template with streamlined content and improved example components

## [0.5.9] - 2026-01-31

No CLI changes in this release; version bump only.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-01-31

This release adds API tokens for CI/CD automation, improves project management with rename support, and includes various UX improvements.

### Features

- **API tokens for CI/CD**: New `tokens` command group for creating and managing API tokens that work without interactive login
  - `scratch tokens create <name>` - Create a new API token (with optional `--expires <days>`)
  - `scratch tokens ls` - List your API tokens with last-used timestamps
  - `scratch tokens revoke <name>` - Revoke a token
  - `scratch tokens use <token>` - Store a token in your credentials file
  - Tokens can be used via `SCRATCH_TOKEN` environment variable, `.env` file, or credentials file
  - API tokens now work with servers behind Cloudflare Access
- **Project rename support**: Projects can now be renamed by changing the name in `.scratch/project.toml` - the CLI tracks project IDs to enable this
- **Build conflict detection**: The build now detects and reports path/URL conflicts early, before other build errors occur

### Improvements

- Commands renamed to Unix-style conventions: `projects list` → `projects ls`, `projects delete` → `projects rm`, `share list` → `share ls`
- Added `--no-open` flag to `publish` command to skip opening the browser after deploy
- Login now shows hints for creating API tokens for CI/CD use
- Token list shows when each token was last used
- Better error messages when publishing with an invalid project ID or name conflict
- Static file handling improvements: `.mdx` files are now renamed to `.md` when copied to the build output
- Removed rarely-used `--no-src`, `--no-package`, and `--minimal` flags from `scratch create`
- Removed `--static` flag from build/dev commands (static files are now always copied)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed publish failing silently when the stored project ID no longer exists on the server

## [0.5.7] - 2026-01-21

This release fixes a conflict between the dev and build commands by using separate output directories.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `scratch dev` overwriting `scratch build` output: the dev server now outputs to `.scratch/dev/` instead of `dist/`, so running dev no longer clobbers your production build
- The `clean` command now also removes `.scratch/dev/`

## [0.5.6] - 2026-01-21

This release improves build error messages and ensures the server URL is always explicitly selected during publish.

### Improvements

- Improved MDX build error messages: errors now include file paths and actionable suggestions when component imports fail or server-side rendering encounters issues
- The `publish` command now always prompts for server selection when no server URL is stored in project config, making it clearer which server you're deploying to
- Updated `.gitignore` template to allow `.scratch/project.toml` to be committed to version control, so project settings can be shared with collaborators

## [0.5.5] - 2026-01-20

This release fixes the checksum file format for release artifacts.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed checksum JSON keys to use platform names (e.g., `darwin-arm64`) instead of full filenames, making verification easier

## [0.5.4] - 2026-01-20

This release adds checksum files to CLI releases for download verification.

### Improvements

- Release artifacts now include SHA256 checksums for verifying download integrity

## [0.5.3] - 2026-01-19

This release fixes project configuration to always store the server URL.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `publish` command to always save the server URL in project config (`.scratch/project.toml`), ensuring projects remember which server they were published to

## [0.5.2] - 2026-01-18

This release simplifies the CLI command structure by removing the `cloud` prefix from server commands and renaming several commands for clarity.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `cloud` command prefix: `cloud login`, `cloud logout`, `cloud whoami`, `cloud deploy`, `cloud projects`, and `cloud share` are now top-level commands
- Renamed `cloud deploy` to `publish` for clearer semantics
- Renamed `checkout` command to `eject` (the `checkout` alias has been removed)
- Removed command aliases: `view` is no longer an alias for `watch`
- Removed global config file (`~/.config/scratch/config.toml`) - server selection is now automatic

### Improvements

- Smart server URL resolution: if logged into exactly one server, it's used automatically; if logged into multiple, you're prompted to choose
- Grouped help output: commands are now organized into Local, Server, and Other categories for easier discovery
- `projects info` now displays the project ID
- `watch` command path argument is now optional (defaults to current directory)
- Better error handling when Cloudflare Access credentials are stale or invalid

## [0.5.1] - 2026-01-16

This release fixes the CLI login flow when connecting to servers protected by Cloudflare Access.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed authentication for servers behind Cloudflare Access: the CLI now properly proceeds to browser-based login instead of failing. The browser handles CF Access authentication, then redirects back with the token.
- When existing service tokens are expired or invalid, the CLI now prompts to either update the token or use browser login instead of failing silently.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-14

This release migrates Scratch to a monorepo structure, laying the groundwork for tighter integration between the CLI and Scratch Cloud server.

### Improvements

- Reorganized repository into a monorepo with dedicated `cli/`, `server/`, and `shared/` packages
- Shared TypeScript types between CLI and server for better consistency
- Installation URL simplified to `https://scratch.dev/install.sh`

## [0.4.7] - 2026-01-14

This release simplifies the CLI authentication flow by replacing the device code polling mechanism with direct browser-based login.

### Improvements

- Simplified login flow: The CLI now opens your browser directly for authentication instead of displaying a code to enter manually. After approving in the browser, authentication completes automatically via localhost callback.
- Styled authentication callback pages to match the Scratch server UI for a consistent experience

## [0.4.6] - 2026-01-14

This release improves Cloudflare Access authentication and reorganizes the build cache location.

### Improvements

- Cloudflare Access login no longer requires a service token - the CLI now automatically detects CF Access and opens your browser to authenticate directly
- Build cache moved from `.scratch-build-cache/` to `.scratch/cache/` for better organization alongside project config

## [0.4.5] - 2026-01-13

This release simplifies the project model by removing namespaces and fixes Cloudflare Access authentication when using service tokens.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed namespace/group concept from the CLI. Projects are now owned directly by users without requiring a namespace prefix.

### Bug Fixes

- Server URLs are automatically normalized (adds `https://` and `app.` subdomain when needed)
- Added `--force` flag to `cloud projects delete` to skip the confirmation prompt

### Improvements

- Credentials and Cloudflare Access tokens are now stored per-server, enabling simultaneous authentication with multiple cloud instances
- Unified cloud command context handling with a new `CloudContext` class for consistent server URL resolution

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-08

This release adds a medium width option to the page width toggle, giving users three layout choices.

### Improvements

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-08

This release improves the Cloudflare Access authentication experience by automatically detecting and handling expired or missing credentials.

### Improvements

- Cloud commands now automatically detect when Cloudflare Access authentication is required or has expired, prompting for new credentials and retrying the request
- Added distinct messages for "token expired" vs "server requires authentication" scenarios to help users understand what action is needed

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-07

This release fixes a security issue with Cloudflare Access credential storage.

### Security

- Cloudflare Access credentials are now stored securely in `~/.scratch/secrets.json` with owner-only permissions (0o600), rather than in the world-readable config file
- Added automatic migration: existing CF Access credentials are moved from the old location to secure storage on first access

### Improvements

- Consolidated configuration handling into a unified `src/config/` library with clear separation between user preferences, secrets, auth credentials, and project config

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-07
